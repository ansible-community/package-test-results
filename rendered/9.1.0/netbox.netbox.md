# Community package requirements: sanity tests

(Note: This issue was filed in a semi-automated fashion. Let me know if you see errors in this issue.)

As per the [Ansible community package inclusion requirements][ci-testing], collections must pass `ansible-test sanity` tests. Version `3.15.0` of `netbox.netbox`, corresponding to the `v3.15.0` tag in this repo, fails one or more of the required sanity tests.


Please see the errors below and address them. If these issues aren't addressed within a reasonable time period, the collection may be subject to [removal from Ansible][removal].

Thank you for your efforts and for being part of the Ansible package! We appreciate it.

## Sanity tests

The following tests were run using `ansible-test` version `2.16.1`:

- ansible-doc
- compile
- validate-modules
- yamllint

Note that this is only a subset of the required sanity tests. Please make sure you run them in all in your CI.

### Results

The test `ansible-test sanity --test compile --python 2.7` [[explain](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-core/2.16/dev_guide/testing/sanity/compile.html)] failed with 2 errors:

``` text
plugins/module_utils/netbox_utils.py:693:59: SyntaxError: self.full_version = f"{self.version}.0"
plugins/module_utils/netbox_wireless.py:58:104: SyntaxError: name = f"{interface_a_device} {interface_a_name} <> {interface_b_device} {interface_b_name}"
