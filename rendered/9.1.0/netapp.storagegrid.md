# Community package requirements: sanity tests

(Note: This issue was filed in a semi-automated fashion. Let me know if you see errors in this issue.)

As per the [Ansible community package inclusion requirements][ci-testing], collections must pass `ansible-test sanity` tests. Version `21.11.1` of `netapp.storagegrid`, corresponding to the `21.11.1` tag in this repo, fails one or more of the required sanity tests.


Please see the errors below and address them. If these issues aren't addressed within a reasonable time period, the collection may be subject to [removal from Ansible][removal].

Thank you for your efforts and for being part of the Ansible package! We appreciate it.

## Sanity tests

The following tests were run using `ansible-test` version `2.16.1`:

- ansible-doc
- compile
- validate-modules
- yamllint

Note that this is only a subset of the required sanity tests. Please make sure you run them in all in your CI.

### Results

The test `ansible-test sanity --test validate-modules` [[explain](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-core/2.16/dev_guide/testing/sanity/validate-modules.html)] failed with 1 error:

``` text
plugins/modules/na_sg_org_group.py:0:0: doc-default-does-not-match-spec: Argument 's3_policy' in argument_spec defines default as (None) but documentation defines default as ('')
