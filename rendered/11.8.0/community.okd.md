# Community package requirements: sanity tests

(Note: This issue was filed in a semi-automated fashion on behalf of the Ansible Community Steering Committee. Let me know if you see errors in this issue.)

As per the [Ansible community package inclusion requirements][ci-testing], collections must pass `ansible-test sanity` tests. Version `4.0.2` of `community.okd`, corresponding to the `4.0.2` tag in this repo, fails one or more of the required sanity tests.


Please see the errors below and address them. If these issues aren't addressed within a reasonable time period, the collection may be subject to [removal from Ansible][removal].

*Please fix the issues identified below and then create a new Galaxy release so the fixes are caught in the next round of automated testing.*

Thank you for your efforts and for being part of the Ansible package! We appreciate it.

## Sanity tests

The following tests were run using `ansible-test` version `2.18.7`:

- ansible-doc
- compile
- validate-modules
- yamllint

Note that this is only a subset of the required sanity tests. Please make sure you run them in all in your CI.

### Results

`ansible-test sanity` succeeded, but some required tests were ignored.

### Invalid test ignores

`tests/sanity/ignore-2.18.txt` contain ignores that are forbidden by the [CI testing requirements][ci-testing]:

``` text
plugins/modules/k8s.py validate-modules:parameter-type-not-in-doc
plugins/modules/openshift_process.py validate-modules:parameter-type-not-in-doc
```

Please fix these issues and remove the ignore entries.
