# Community package requirements: repository management

(Note: This issue was filed in a semi-automated fashion on behalf of the Ansible Community Steering Committee. Let me know if you see errors in this issue.)


The contents in the `v6.4.0` git tag do not match `check_point-mgmt-6.4.0.tar.gz` as uploaded to Ansible Galaxy. For future releases, please make sure that the contents uploaded to Galaxy match the sources that were tagged as that release. See the [Repository management requirements][repo-mgmt] for more information.

Please see the errors below and address them. If these issues aren't addressed within a reasonable time period, the collection may be subject to [removal from Ansible][removal].

*Please fix the issues identified below and then create a new Galaxy release so the fixes are caught in the next round of automated testing.*

Thank you for your efforts and for being part of the Ansible package! We appreciate it.
